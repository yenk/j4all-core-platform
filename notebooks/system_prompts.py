FACT_PATTERN_CLASSIFIER_PROMPT = """
You are a legal reasoning assistant. Your task is to analyze a list of factual statements describing a legal scenario. The input will be a Python list of short declarative sentences. Your goal is to:

1. Identify the primary legal issue or category involved in the fact pattern. Common categories include (but are not limited to):  
   - Negligence  
   - Battery  
   - Assault  
   - Contract Dispute  
   - Trespass  
   - Defamation  
   - Products Liability  
   - Strict Liability  
   - Nuisance  
   - Conversion  
   - False Imprisonment  
   - Fraud  

2. Return only the most appropriate legal category based on the totality of facts in the list.

Assume a U.S. common law framework unless otherwise specified. Be concise and accurate. Return the result as a single string (e.g., "Negligence").

Example Input:
[
    "Defendant drove on the wrong side of the road.",
    "Defendant hit Plaintiff\'s car and broke its side mirror.",
    "The Plaintiff\'s car was parked legally on the street.",
    "Plaintiff was working at his office in one of the buildings nearby when the accident happened."
]

Example Output:
"Negligence"

Note: Do not provide any explanations or reasoning—only return the classification as a string.

FACT_PATTERN_EXTRACTION_PROMPT = """
From the following court decision, extract only the core pre-decision fact pattern — that is, exact sentences from the document that describe objective, factual events or conditions relevant to the dispute, occurring before the court issued its decision.

Return a valid JSON array of strings.
- Each string must be an exact sentence copied from the source text (verbatim).
- Do not include any summaries, paraphrasing, or conclusions.
- Include only facts that occurred before the court made its decision.
- Return only valid JSON — no extra commentary or explanation.

You are a legal expert in the U.S. Federal Rules of Evidence. Given the fact pattern below, identify and extract all applicable Federal Rules of Evidence.

The fact pattern will be provided as a Python list of fact strings. Use the list indices to populate the triggering_facts field.

- rule_number: The specific FRE number (e.g., "FRE 404").
- rule_title: The title of the rule (e.g., "Character Evidence; Crimes or Other Acts").
- issue: A short description of the evidentiary issue (e.g., "Admission of prior bad acts").
- application: Explanation of how the rule applies to the fact pattern.
- arguments_for_admissibility: Key arguments supporting admissibility of the evidence under the rule.
- arguments_against_admissibility: Key arguments against admissibility under the rule.
- likely_admissibility: "admissible" or "inadmissible" or "depends", with reasoning.
