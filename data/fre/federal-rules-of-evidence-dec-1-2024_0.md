## **ARTICLE I. GENERAL PROVISIONS**  

### **Rule 101\. Scope; Definitions**  

(a) SCOPE. These rules apply to proceedings in United States courts. The specific courts and proceedings to which the rules apply, along with exceptions, are set out in Rule 1101\.  

(b) DEFINITIONS. In these rules:    

    (1) ‘‘civil case’’ means a civil action or proceeding;    
    (2) ‘‘criminal case’’ includes a criminal proceeding;    
    (3) ‘‘public office’’ includes a public agency;  
    (4) ‘‘record’’ includes a memorandum, report, or data compilation;    
    (5) a ‘‘rule prescribed by the Supreme Court’’ means a rule adopted by the Supreme Court under statutory authority; and  (6) a reference to any kind of written material or any other medium includes electronically stored information.  

(As amended Mar. 2, 1987, eff. Oct. 1, 1987; Apr. 25, 1988, eff. Nov.  1, 1988; Apr. 22, 1993, eff. Dec.1, 1993; Apr. 26, 2011, eff. Dec. 1, 2011.)  

### **Rule 102\. Purpose**  

These rules should be construed so as to administer every proceeding fairly, eliminate unjustifiable expense and delay, and promote the development of evidence law, to the end of ascertaining the truth and securing a just determination.  

(As amended Apr. 26, 2011, eff. Dec. 1, 2011.)  

### **Rule 103\. Rulings on Evidence**  

(a) PRESERVING A CLAIM OF ERROR. A party may claim error in  a ruling to admit or exclude evidence only if the error affects a  substantial right of the party and:    

    (1) if the ruling admits evidence, a party, on the record:  
        (A) timely objects or moves to strike; and  
        (B) states the specific ground, unless it was apparent  from the context; or   

    (2) if the ruling excludes evidence, a party informs the court of its substance by an offer of proof, unless the substance was apparent from the context.    

(b) NOT NEEDING TO RENEW AN OBJECTION OR OFFER OF PROOF.  Once the court rules definitively on the record—either before or at trial—a party need not renew an objection or offer of proof to preserve a claim of error for appeal.    
(c) COURT’S STATEMENT ABOUT THE RULING; DIRECTING AN OFFER OF PROOF. The court may make any statement about the character or form of the evidence, the objection made, and the ruling. 

The court may direct that an offer of proof be made in question-and-answer form.    
(d) PREVENTING THE JURY FROM HEARING INADMISSIBLE EVIDENCE.  To the extent practicable, the court must conduct a jury trial so that inadmissible evidence is not suggested to the jury by any  means.    
(e) TAKING NOTICE OF PLAIN ERROR. A court may take notice of a plain error affecting a substantial right, even if the claim of error was not properly preserved.  

(As amended Apr. 17, 2000, eff. Dec. 1, 2000; Apr. 26, 2011, eff. Dec.  1, 2011.)  

**Rule 104\. Preliminary Questions**  

(a) IN GENERAL. The court must decide any preliminary question about whether a witness is qualified, a privilege exists, or evidence is admissible. In so deciding, the court is not bound by evidence rules, except those on privilege.    
(b) RELEVANCE THAT DEPENDS ON A FACT. When the relevance of evidence depends on whether a fact exists, proof must be introduced sufficient to support a finding that the fact does exist. The court may admit the proposed evidence on the condition that the proof be introduced later.    
(c) CONDUCTING A HEARING SO THAT THE JURY CANNOT HEAR IT.  The court must conduct any hearing on a preliminary question so  that the jury cannot hear it if:    

    (1) the hearing involves the admissibility of a confession;  
    (2) a defendant in a criminal case is a witness and so requests; or    
    (3) justice so requires.  

(d) CROSS\-EXAMINING A DEFENDANT IN A CRIMINAL CASE. By testifying on a preliminary question, a defendant in a criminal case does not become subject to cross-examination on other issues in the case.    
(e) EVIDENCE RELEVANT TO WEIGHT AND CREDIBILITY. This rule does not limit a party’s right to introduce before the jury evidence that is relevant to the weight or credibility of other evidence.  

(As amended Mar. 2, 1987, eff. Oct. 1, 1987; Apr. 26, 2011, eff. Dec.  1, 2011.)  

### **Rule 105\. Limiting Evidence That Is Not Admissible Against Other  Parties or for Other Purposes**  

If the court admits evidence that is admissible against a party or for a purpose—but not against another party or for another purpose—the court, on timely request, must restrict the evidence to its proper scope and instruct the jury accordingly.  

(As amended Apr. 26, 2011, eff. Dec. 1, 2011.)  

### **Rule 106\. Remainder of or Related Statements**  

If a party introduces all or part of a statement, an adverse party may require the introduction, at that time, of any other part—or any other statement—that in fairness ought to be considered at the same time. The adverse party may do so over a hearsay objection. 

(As amended Mar. 2, 1987, eff. Oct. 1, 1987; Apr. 26, 2011, eff. Dec.  1, 2011; Apr. 24, 2023, eff. Dec. 1, 2023.)  

### **Rule 107\. Illustrative Aids**  

(a) PERMITTED USES. The court may allow a party to present an  illustrative aid to help the trier of fact understand the evidence  or argument if the aid’s utility in assisting comprehension is not  substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice, con 

fusing the issues, misleading the jury, undue delay, or wasting time.  

(b) USE IN JURY DELIBERATIONS. An illustrative aid is not evidence and must not be provided to the jury during deliberations  unless:  

    (1) all parties consent; or  

    (2) the court, for good cause, orders otherwise.  

(c) RECORD. When practicable, an illustrative aid used at trial must be entered into the record.  

(d) SUMMARIES OF VOLUMINOUS MATERIALS ADMITTED AS EVIDENCE. A summary, chart, or calculation admitted as evidence to prove the content of voluminous admissible evidence is governed by Rule 1006\.  

(As added Apr. 2, 2024, eff. Dec. 1, 2024.)  

## **ARTICLE II. JUDICIAL NOTICE**  

### **Rule 201\. Judicial Notice of Adjudicative Facts**  

(a) SCOPE. This rule governs judicial notice of an adjudicative  fact only, not a legislative fact.  

(b) KINDS OF FACTS THAT MAY BE JUDICIALLY NOTICED. The court  may judicially notice a fact that is not subject to reasonable dispute because it:  

    (1) is generally known within the trial court’s territorial jurisdiction; or  

    (2) can be accurately and readily determined from sources whose accuracy cannot reasonably be questioned.  

(c) TAKING NOTICE. The court:  

    (1) may take judicial notice on its own; or  

    (2) must take judicial notice if a party requests it and the court is supplied with the necessary information.  

(d) TIMING. The court may take judicial notice at any stage of the proceeding.  

(e) OPPORTUNITY TO BE HEARD. On timely request, a party is entitled to be heard on the propriety of taking judicial notice and the nature of the fact to be noticed. If the court takes judicial notice before notifying a party, the party, on request, is still entitled to be heard.  

(f) INSTRUCTING THE JURY. In a civil case, the court must instruct the jury to accept the noticed fact as conclusive. In a criminal case, the court must instruct the jury that it may or may not accept the noticed fact as conclusive.  

(As amended Apr. 26, 2011, eff. Dec. 1, 2011.) 

## **ARTICLE III. PRESUMPTIONS IN CIVIL CASES**  

### **Rule 301\. Presumptions in Civil Cases Generally**  

In a civil case, unless a federal statute or these rules provide otherwise, the party against whom a presumption is directed has the burden of producing evidence to rebut the presumption. But  this rule does not shift the burden of persuasion, which remains  on the party who had it originally.  

(As amended Apr. 26, 2011, eff. Dec. 1, 2011.)  

### **Rule 302\. Applying State Law to Presumptions in Civil Cases**  

In a civil case, state law governs the effect of a presumption regarding a claim or defense for which state law supplies the rule of decision.  

(As amended Apr. 26, 2011, eff. Dec. 1, 2011.)  

## **ARTICLE IV. RELEVANCE AND ITS LIMITS**  

**Rule 401\. Test for Relevant Evidence**  

Evidence is relevant if:    
(a) it has any tendency to make a fact more or less probable than it would be without the evidence; and  

(b) the fact is of consequence in determining the action.  (As amended Apr. 26, 2011, eff. Dec. 1, 2011.)  

### **Rule 402\. General Admissibility of Relevant Evidence**  

Relevant evidence is admissible unless any of the following provides otherwise:  

• the United States Constitution;    
• a federal statute;    
• these rules; or    
• other rules prescribed by the Supreme Court.    
Irrelevant evidence is not admissible.  

(As amended Apr. 26, 2011, eff. Dec. 1, 2011.)  

### **Rule 403\. Excluding Relevant Evidence for Prejudice, Confusion,  Waste of Time, or Other Reasons**  

The court may exclude relevant evidence if its probative value is substantially outweighed by a danger of one or more of the following: unfair prejudice, confusing the issues, misleading the jury,  undue delay, wasting time, or needlessly presenting cumulative evidence.  

(As amended Apr. 26, 2011, eff. Dec. 1, 2011.)  

### **Rule 404\. Character Evidence; Other Crimes, Wrongs, or Acts**  

(a) CHARACTER EVIDENCE.    

    (1) *Prohibited Uses.* Evidence of a person’s character or character trait is not admissible to prove that on a particular occasion the person acted in accordance with the character or trait.  

    (2) *Exceptions for a Defendant or Victim in a Criminal Case.* The  following exceptions apply in a criminal case: 

        (A) a defendant may offer evidence of the defendant’s  pertinent trait, and if the evidence is admitted, the prosecutor may offer evidence to rebut it;    
        (B) subject to the limitations in Rule 412, a defendant  may offer evidence of an alleged victim’s pertinent trait,  and if the evidence is admitted, the prosecutor may:  

            (i) offer evidence to rebut it; and    
            (ii) offer evidence of the defendant’s same trait; and  

        (C) in a homicide case, the prosecutor may offer evidence of the alleged victim’s trait of peacefulness to rebut evidence that the victim was the first aggressor.    
        
    (3) *Exceptions for a Witness.* Evidence of a witness’s character may be admitted under Rules 607, 608, and 609\.    

(b) OTHER CRIMES, WRONGS, OR ACTS.    

    (1) *Prohibited Uses.* Evidence of any other crime, wrong, or act is not admissible to prove a person’s character in order to show that on a particular occasion the person acted in accordance with the character.    
    (2) *Permitted Uses.* This evidence may be admissible for another purpose, such as proving motive, opportunity, intent,  preparation, plan, knowledge, identity, absence of mistake, or lack of accident.    
    (3) *Notice in a Criminal Case.* In a criminal case, the prosecutor must:    

        (A) provide reasonable notice of any such evidence that  the prosecutor intends to offer at trial, so that the defendant has a fair opportunity to meet it;    
        (B) articulate in the notice the permitted purpose for  which the prosecutor intends to offer the evidence and the  reasoning that supports the purpose; and    
        (C) do so in writing before trial—or in any form during trial if the court, for good cause, excuses lack of pretrial notice.

### **Rule 405\. Methods of Proving Character**  

(a) BY REPUTATION OR OPINION. When evidence of a person’s character or character trait is admissible, it may be proved by testimony about the person’s reputation or by testimony in the form of an opinion. On cross-examination of the character witness, the  court may allow an inquiry into relevant specific instances of the  person’s conduct.    
(b) BY SPECIFIC INSTANCES OF CONDUCT. When a person’s character or character trait is an essential element of a charge, claim,  or defense, the character or trait may also be proved by relevant specific instances of the person’s conduct.

Evidence of a person’s habit or an organization’s routine practice may be admitted to prove that on a particular occasion the

(As amended Apr. 26, 2011, eff. Dec. 1, 2011.)  

### **Rule 407\. Subsequent Remedial Measures**

• negligence;    
• culpable conduct;    
• a defect in a product or its design; or    
• a need for a warning or instruction.    
But the court may admit this evidence for another purpose, such  as impeachment or—if disputed—proving ownership, control, or  the feasibility of precautionary measures.  

(As amended Apr. 11, 1997, eff. Dec. 1, 1997; Apr. 26, 2011, eff. Dec.  1, 2011.)

    (1) furnishing, promising, or offering—or accepting, promising to accept, or offering to accept—a valuable consideration  in compromising or attempting to compromise the claim; and    
    (2) conduct or a statement made during compromise negotiations about the claim—except when offered in a criminal case and when the negotiations related to a claim by a public office in the exercise of its regulatory, investigative, or enforcement authority.    

(b) EXCEPTIONS. The court may admit this evidence for another  purpose, such as proving a witness’s bias or prejudice, negating a  contention of undue delay, or proving an effort to obstruct a  criminal investigation or prosecution.  

(As amended Apr. 12, 2006, eff. Dec. 1, 2006; Apr. 26, 2011, eff. Dec.  1, 2011.)

(b) EXCEPTIONS. The court may admit a statement described in  Rule 410(a)(3) or (4):    

    (1) in any proceeding in which another statement made during the same plea or plea discussions has been introduced, if  in fairness the statements ought to be considered together; or    
    (2) in a criminal proceeding for perjury or false statement,  if the defendant made the statement under oath, on the record, and with counsel present.

        (C) evidence whose exclusion would violate the defendant’s constitutional rights. 

    (2) *Civil Cases.* In a civil case, the court may admit evidence offered to prove a victim’s sexual behavior or sexual predisposition if its probative value substantially outweighs the danger of harm to any victim and of unfair prejudice to any party.

## **ARTICLE V. PRIVILEGES**  

### **Rule 501\. Privilege in General**  

The common law—as interpreted by United States courts in the  light of reason and experience—governs a claim of privilege unless  any of the following provides otherwise:    
• the United States Constitution;    
• a federal statute; or    
• rules prescribed by the Supreme Court.    
But in a civil case, state law governs privilege regarding a claim  or defense for which state law supplies the rule of decision.   
 

(As amended Apr. 26, 2011, eff. Dec. 1, 2011.)  

### **Rule 502\. Attorney-Client Privilege and Work Product; Limitations  on Waiver**  

The following provisions apply, in the circumstances set out, to disclosure of a communication or information covered by the attorney-client privilege or work-product protection.    
(a) DISCLOSURE MADE IN A FEDERAL PROCEEDING OR TO A FEDERAL OFFICE OR AGENCY; SCOPE OF A WAIVER. When the disclosure is  made in a federal proceeding or to a federal office or agency and  waives the attorney-client privilege or work-product protection,  the waiver extends to an undisclosed communication or information in a federal or state proceeding only if:   

    (1) the waiver is intentional;    
    (2) the disclosed and undisclosed communications or information concern the same subject matter; and    
    (3) They ought in fairness to be considered together.  

(b) INADVERTENT DISCLOSURE. When made in a federal proceeding  or to a federal office or agency, the disclosure does not operate as  a waiver in a federal or state proceeding if:  

    (1) the disclosure is inadvertent;    
    (2) the holder of the privilege or protection took reasonable  steps to prevent disclosure; and    
    (3) the holder promptly took reasonable steps to rectify the error, including (if applicable) following Federal Rule of Civil  Procedure 26(b)(5)(B).    

(c) DISCLOSURE MADE IN A STATE PROCEEDING. When the disclosure is made in a state proceeding and is not the subject of a  state-court order concerning waiver, the disclosure does not operate as a waiver in a federal proceeding if the disclosure:    

    (1) would not be a waiver under this rule if it had been made  in a federal proceeding; or    
    (2) is not a waiver under the law of the state where the disclosure occurred.    

(d) CONTROLLING EFFECT OF A COURT ORDER. A federal court may order that the privilege or protection is not waived by disclosure connected with the litigation pending before the court—in which  event the disclosure is also not a waiver in any other federal or state proceeding.    
(e) CONTROLLING EFFECT OF A PARTY AGREEMENT. An agreement  on the effect of disclosure in a federal proceeding is binding only  on the parties to the agreement, unless it is incorporated into a  court order.    
(f) CONTROLLING EFFECT OF THIS RULE. Notwithstanding Rules  101 and 1101, this rule applies to state proceedings and to federal court-annexed and federal court-mandated arbitration proceedings, in the circumstances set out in the rule. And notwithstanding Rule 501, this rule applies even if state law provides the rule of decision.    
(g) DEFINITIONS. In this rule:

## **ARTICLE VI. WITNESSES**  

### **Rule 601\. Competency to Testify in General**  

Every person is competent to be a witness unless these rules provide otherwise. But in a civil case, state law governs the  witness’s competency regarding a claim or defense for which state  law supplies the rule of decision.  

(As amended Apr. 26, 2011, eff. Dec. 1, 2011.)  

### **Rule 602\. Need for Personal Knowledge**  

A witness may testify to a matter only if evidence is introduced  sufficient to support a finding that the witness has personal  knowledge of the matter. Evidence to prove personal knowledge may consist of the witness’s own testimony. This rule does not apply to a witness’s expert testimony under Rule 703\.  

(As amended Mar. 2, 1987, eff. Oct. 1, 1987; Apr. 25, 1988, eff. Nov.  1, 1988; Apr. 26, 2011, eff. Dec. 1, 2011.)  

### **Rule 603\. Oath or Affirmation to Testify Truthfully**  

Before testifying, a witness must give an oath or affirmation to testify truthfully. It must be in a form designed to impress that  duty on the witness’s conscience.  

(As amended Mar. 2, 1987, eff. Oct. 1, 1987; Apr. 26, 2011, eff. Dec.  1, 2011.)  

### **Rule 604\. Interpreter**  

An interpreter must be qualified and must give an oath or affirmation to make a true translation.  

(As amended Mar. 2, 1987, eff. Oct. 1, 1987; Apr. 26, 2011, eff. Dec.  1, 2011.)  

### **Rule 605\. Judge’s Competency as a Witness**  

The presiding judge may not testify as a witness at the trial. A  party need not object to preserve the issue.  

(As amended Apr. 26, 2011, eff. Dec. 1, 2011.)  

### **Rule 606\. Juror’s Competency as a Witness**  

(a) AT THE TRIAL. A juror may not testify as a witness before the other jurors at the trial. If a juror is called to testify, the court must give a party an opportunity to object outside the jury’s presence.    
(b) DURING AN INQUIRY INTO THE VALIDITY OF A VERDICT OR IN DICTMENT.    

    (1) *Prohibited Testimony or Other Evidence.* During an inquiry into the validity of a verdict or indictment, a juror may not testify about any statement made or incident that occurred during the jury’s deliberations; the effect of anything on that juror’s or another juror’s vote; or any juror’s mental processes concerning the verdict or indictment. The court may not receive a juror’s affidavit or evidence of a juror’s statement on these matters. 

    (2) *Exceptions.* A juror may testify about whether: 

        (A) extraneous prejudicial information was improperly  brought to the jury’s attention;    
        (B) an outside influence was improperly brought to bear  on any juror; or    

    (C) a mistake was made in entering the verdict on the verdict form.  

(As amended Pub. L. 94–149, § 1(10), Dec. 12, 1975, 89 Stat. 805; Mar.  2, 1987, eff. Oct. 1, 1987; Apr. 12, 2006, eff. Dec. 1, 2006; Apr. 26, 2011,  eff. Dec. 1, 2011.)  

### **Rule 607\. Who May Impeach a Witness**  

Any party, including the party that called the witness, may attack the witness’s credibility.  

(As amended Mar. 2, 1987, eff. Oct. 1, 1987; Apr. 26, 2011, eff. Dec.  1, 2011.)  

### **Rule 608\. A Witness’s Character for Truthfulness or Untruthfulness**  

(a) REPUTATION OR OPINION EVIDENCE. A witness’s credibility  may be attacked or supported by testimony about the witness’s  reputation for having a character for truthfulness or untruthfulness, or by testimony in the form of an opinion about that char acter. But evidence of truthful character is admissible only after  the witness’s character for truthfulness has been attacked.    
(b) SPECIFIC INSTANCES OF CONDUCT. Except for a criminal con viction under Rule 609, extrinsic evidence is not admissible to  prove specific instances of a witness’s conduct in order to attack  or support the witness’s character for truthfulness. But the court  may, on cross-examination, allow them to be inquired into if they  are probative of the character for truthfulness or untruthfulness  of:  

    (1) the witness; or    
    (2) another witness whose character the witness being cross examined has testified about.    

By testifying on another matter, a witness does not waive any  privilege against self-incrimination for testimony that relates  only to the witness’s character for truthfulness.  

(As amended Mar. 2, 1987, eff. Oct. 1, 1987; Apr. 25, 1988, eff. Nov.  1, 1988; Mar. 27, 2003, eff. Dec. 1, 2003; Apr. 26, 2011, eff. Dec. 1, 2011.)  

### **Rule 609\. Impeachment by Evidence of a Criminal Conviction**  

(a) IN GENERAL. The following rules apply to attacking a  witness’s character for truthfulness by evidence of a criminal conviction:  

(1) for a crime that, in the convicting jurisdiction, was punishable by death or by imprisonment for more than one year,  the evidence:    

    (A) must be admitted, subject to Rule 403, in a civil case  or in a criminal case in which the witness is not a defendant; and    
    (B) must be admitted in a criminal case in which the  witness is a defendant, if the probative value of the evidence outweighs its prejudicial effect to that defendant;  and   
 

    (2) for any crime regardless of the punishment, the evidence  must be admitted if the court can readily determine that establishing the elements of the crime required proving—or the  witness’s admitting—a dishonest act or false statement.    

(b) LIMIT ON USING THE EVIDENCE AFTER 10 Years. This subdivision (b) applies if more than 10 years have passed since the  witness’s conviction or release from confinement for it, whichever  is later. Evidence of the conviction is admissible only if:    

    (1) its probative value, supported by specific facts and circumstances, substantially outweighs its prejudicial effect; and  (2) the proponent gives an adverse party reasonable written  notice of the intent to use it so that the party has a fair op portunity to contest its use.   

(c) EFFECT OF A PARDON, ANNULMENT, OR CERTIFICATE OF REHABILITATION. Evidence of a conviction is not admissible if:  

    (1) the conviction has been the subject of a pardon, annul ment, certificate of rehabilitation, or other equivalent proce dure based on a finding that the person has been rehabilitated,  and the person has not been convicted of a later crime punish able by death or by imprisonment for more than one year; or  
    (2) the conviction has been the subject of a pardon, annul ment, or other equivalent procedure based on a finding of in nocence.   

(d) JUVENILE ADJUDICATIONS. Evidence of a juvenile adjudication  is admissible under this rule only if:    

    (1) it is offered in a criminal case;    
    (2) the adjudication was of a witness other than the defendant;    
    (3) an adult’s conviction for that offense would be admissible  to attack the adult’s credibility; and    
    (4) admitting the evidence is necessary to fairly determine  guilt or innocence.    

(e) PENDENCY OF AN APPEAL. A conviction that satisfies this rule  is admissible even if an appeal is pending. Evidence of the pend ency is also admissible.  

(As amended Mar. 2, 1987, eff. Oct. 1, 1987; Jan. 26, 1990, eff. Dec.  1, 1990; Apr. 12, 2006, eff. Dec. 1, 2006; Apr. 26, 2011, eff. Dec. 1, 2011.)  

### **Rule 610\. Religious Beliefs or Opinions**  

Evidence of a witness’s religious beliefs or opinions is not admissible to attack or support the witness’s credibility.  

(As amended Mar. 2, 1987, eff. Oct. 1, 1987; Apr. 26, 2011, eff. Dec.  1, 2011.)  

### **Rule 611\. Mode and Order of Examining Witnesses and Presenting  Evidence**  

(a) CONTROL BY THE COURT; PURPOSES. The court should exercise  reasonable control over the mode and order of examining witnesses and presenting evidence so as to:    

    (1) make those procedures effective for determining the  truth;    
    (2) avoid wasting time; and    
    (3) protect witnesses from harassment or undue embarrassment. 

(b) SCOPE OF CROSS\-EXAMINATION. Cross-examination should not  go beyond the subject matter of the direct examination and matters affecting the witness’s credibility. The court may allow in inquiry into additional matters as if on direct examination.  

(c) LEADING QUESTIONS. Leading questions should not be used on  direct examination except as necessary to develop the witness’s  testimony. Ordinarily, the court should allow leading questions:  (1) on cross-examination; and  

(2) when a party calls a hostile witness, an adverse party, or  a witness identified with an adverse party.  

(As amended Mar. 2, 1987, eff. Oct. 1, 1987; Apr. 26, 2011, eff. Dec.  1, 2011.)  

### **Rule 612\. Writing Used to Refresh a Witness’s Memory**  

(a) SCOPE. This rule gives an adverse party certain options when  a witness uses a writing to refresh memory:  

    (1) while testifying; or  

    (2) before testifying, if the court decides that justice requires the party to have those options.  

(b) ADVERSE PARTY’S OPTIONS; DELETING UNRELATED MATTER.  Unless 18 U.S.C. § 3500 provides otherwise in a criminal case, an adverse party is entitled to have the writing produced at the hearing, to inspect it, to cross-examine the witness about it, and to introduce in evidence any portion that relates to the witness’s testimony. If the producing party claims that the writing includes unrelated matter, the court must examine the writing in camera, delete any unrelated portion, and order that the rest be delivered to  the adverse party. Any portion deleted over objection must be preserved for the record.  

(c) FAILURE TO PRODUCE OR DELIVER THE WRITING. If a writing is  not produced or is not delivered as ordered, the court may issue  any appropriate order. But if the prosecution does not comply in  a criminal case, the court must strike the witness’s testimony  or—if justice so requires—declare a mistrial.  

(As amended Mar. 2, 1987, eff. Oct. 1, 1987; Apr. 26, 2011, eff. Dec.  1, 2011.)  

### **Rule 613\. Witness’s Prior Statement**  

(a) SHOWING OR DISCLOSING THE STATEMENT DURING EXAMINATION. When examining a witness about the witness’s prior statement, a party need not show it or disclose its contents to the witness. But the party must, on request, show it or disclose its contents to an adverse party’s attorney.  

(b) EXTRINSIC EVIDENCE OF A PRIOR INCONSISTENT STATEMENT.  Unless the court orders otherwise, extrinsic evidence of a  witness’s prior inconsistent statement may not be admitted until  after the witness is given an opportunity to explain or deny the  statement and an adverse party is given an opportunity to examine the witness about it. This subdivision (b) does not apply to an  opposing party’s statement under Rule 801(d)(2).  

(As amended Mar. 2, 1987, eff. Oct. 1, 1987; Apr. 25, 1988, eff. Nov.  1, 1988; Apr. 26, 2011, eff. Dec. 1, 2011; Apr. 2, 2024, eff. Dec. 1, 2024.)   
 

### **Rule 614\. Court’s Calling or Examining a Witness**  

(a) CALLING. The court may call a witness on its own or at a party’s request. Each party is entitled to cross-examine the witness.  (b) EXAMINING. The court may examine a witness regardless of  who calls the witness.  

(c) OBJECTIONS. A party may object to the court’s calling or examining a witness either at that time or at the next opportunity  when the jury is not present.  

(As amended Apr. 26, 2011, eff. Dec. 1, 2011.)  

### **Rule 615\. Excluding Witnesses from the Courtroom; Preventing an  Excluded Witness’s Access to Trial Testimony**  

(a) EXCLUDING WITNESSES. At a party’s request, the court must  order witnesses excluded from the courtroom so that they cannot  hear other witnesses’ testimony. Or the court may do so on its  own. But this rule does not authorize excluding:    

    (1) a party who is a natural person;    
    (2) one officer or employee of a party that is not a natural  person if that officer or employee has been designated as the  party’s representative by its attorney;    
    (3) any person whose presence a party shows to be essential  to presenting the party’s claim or defense; or    
    (4) a person authorized by statute to be present.    

(b) ADDITIONAL ORDERS TO PREVENT DISCLOSING AND ACCESSING TESTIMONY. An order under (a) operates only to exclude witnesses  from the courtroom. But the court may also, by order:    

    (1) prohibit disclosure of trial testimony to witnesses who  are excluded from the courtroom; and  

    (2) prohibit excluded witnesses from accessing trial testimony.  

(As amended Mar. 2, 1987, eff. Oct. 1, 1987; Apr. 25, 1988, eff. Nov.  1, 1988; Pub. L. 100–690, title VII, § 7075(a), Nov. 18, 1988, 102 Stat.  4405; Apr. 24, 1998, eff. Dec. 1, 1998; Apr. 26, 2011, eff. Dec. 1, 2011;  Apr. 24, 2023, eff. Dec. 1, 2023.)  

## **ARTICLE VII. OPINIONS AND EXPERT TESTIMONY**  

### **Rule 701\. Opinion Testimony by Lay Witnesses**  

If a witness is not testifying as an expert, testimony in the form  of an opinion is limited to one that is:  

(a) rationally based on the witness’s perception;    
(b) helpful to clearly understanding the witness’s testimony  or to determining a fact in issue; and  
(c) not based on scientific, technical, or other specialized  knowledge within the scope of Rule 702\.  

(As amended Mar. 2, 1987, eff. Oct. 1, 1987; Apr. 17, 2000, eff. Dec.  1, 2000; Apr. 26, 2011, eff. Dec. 1, 2011.)  

### **Rule 702\. Testimony by Expert Witnesses**  

A witness who is qualified as an expert by knowledge, skill, experience, training, or education may testify in the form of an  opinion or otherwise if the proponent demonstrates to the court  that it is more likely than not that: 

(a) the expert’s scientific, technical, or other specialized  knowledge will help the trier of fact to understand the evidence or to determine a fact in issue;    
(b) the testimony is based on sufficient facts or data;  
(c) the testimony is the product of reliable principles and  methods; and    
(d) the expert’s opinion reflects a reliable application of the  principles and methods to the facts of the case.  

(As amended Apr. 17, 2000, eff. Dec. 1, 2000; Apr. 26, 2011, eff. Dec.  1, 2011; Apr. 24, 2023, eff. Dec. 1, 2023.)  

### **Rule 703\. Bases of an Expert’s Opinion Testimony**  

An expert may base an opinion on facts or data in the case that  the expert has been made aware of or personally observed. If experts in the particular field would reasonably rely on those kinds  of facts or data in forming an opinion on the subject, they need  not be admissible for the opinion to be admitted. But if the facts  or data would otherwise be inadmissible, the proponent of the  opinion may disclose them to the jury only if their probative  value in helping the jury evaluate the opinion substantially outweighs their prejudicial effect.  

(As amended Mar. 2, 1987, eff. Oct. 1, 1987; Apr. 17, 2000, eff. Dec.  1, 2000; Apr. 26, 2011, eff. Dec. 1, 2011.)  

### **Rule 704\. Opinion on an Ultimate Issue**  

(a) IN GENERAL—NOT AUTOMATICALLY OBJECTIONABLE. An opinion is not objectionable just because it embraces an ultimate  issue.    
(b) EXCEPTION. In a criminal case, an expert witness must not  state an opinion about whether the defendant did or did not have  a mental state or condition that constitutes an element of the  crime charged or of a defense. Those matters are for the trier of  fact alone.  

(As amended Pub. L. 98–473, title II, § 406, Oct. 12, 1984, 98 Stat.  2067; Apr. 26, 2011, eff. Dec. 1, 2011.)  

### **Rule 705\. Disclosing the Facts or Data Underlying an Expert’s  Opinion**  

Unless the court orders otherwise, an expert may state an opinion—and give the reasons for it—without first testifying to the  underlying facts or data. But the expert may be required to disclose those facts or data on cross-examination.  

(As amended Mar. 2, 1987, eff. Oct. 1, 1987; Apr. 22, 1993, eff. Dec.  1, 1993; Apr. 26, 2011, eff. Dec. 1, 2011.)  

### **Rule 706\. Court-Appointed Expert Witnesses**  

(a) APPOINTMENT PROCESS. On a party’s motion or on its own,  the court may order the parties to show cause why expert witnesses should not be appointed and may ask the parties to submit  nominations. The court may appoint any expert that the parties  agree on and any of its own choosing. But the court may only appoint someone who consents to act.    
(b) EXPERT’S ROLE. The court must inform the expert of the expert’s duties. The court may do so in writing and have a copy filed with the clerk or may do so orally at a conference in which the  parties have an opportunity to participate. The expert:  

    (1) must advise the parties of any findings the expert makes;  
    (2) may be deposed by any party;    
    (3) may be called to testify by the court or any party; and  (4) may be cross-examined by any party, including the party  that called the expert.    

(c) COMPENSATION. The expert is entitled to a reasonable compensation, as set by the court. The compensation is payable as follows:  

    (1) in a criminal case or in a civil case involving just compensation under the Fifth Amendment, from any funds that  are provided by law; and    
    (2) in any other civil case, by the parties in the proportion  and at the time that the court directs—and the compensation  is then charged like other costs.    
(d) DISCLOSING THE APPOINTMENT TO THE JURY. The court may  authorize disclosure to the jury that the court appointed the expert.    
(e) PARTIES’ CHOICE OF THEIR OWN EXPERTS. This rule does not  limit a party in calling its own experts.  

(As amended Mar. 2, 1987, eff. Oct. 1, 1987; Apr. 26, 2011, eff. Dec.  1, 2011.)  

## **ARTICLE VIII. HEARSAY**  

### **Rule 801\. Definitions That Apply to This Article; Exclusions from  Hearsay**  

(a) STATEMENT. ‘‘Statement’’ means a person’s oral assertion,  written assertion, or nonverbal conduct, if the person intended it  as an assertion.    
(b) DECLARANT. ‘‘Declarant’’ means the person who made the  statement.    
(c) HEARSAY. ‘‘Hearsay’’ means a statement that:    

    (1) the declarant does not make while testifying at the current trial or hearing; and    
    (2) a party offers in evidence to prove the truth of the matter  asserted in the statement.    

(d) STATEMENTS THAT ARE NOT HEARSAY. A statement that  meets the following conditions is not hearsay:  

    (1) *A Declarant-Witness’s Prior Statement.* The declarant testifies and is subject to cross-examination about a prior statement, and the statement:  

        (A) is inconsistent with the declarant’s testimony and  was given under penalty of perjury at a trial, hearing, or  other proceeding or in a deposition;    
        (B) is consistent with the declarant’s testimony and is  offered:  

            (i) to rebut an express or implied charge that the declarant recently fabricated it or acted from a recent  improper influence or motive in so testifying; or    
            (ii) to rehabilitate the declarant’s credibility as a  witness when attacked on another ground; or   
        
        (C) identifies a person as someone the declarant perceived earlier.   
    
    (2) *An Opposing Party’s Statement.* The statement is offered  against an opposing party and:

        (B) is one the party manifested that it adopted or believed to be true;    
        (C) was made by a person whom the party authorized to  make a statement on the subject;    
        (D) was made by the party’s agent or employee on a mat ter within the scope of that relationship and while it existed; or    
        (E) was made by the party’s coconspirator during and in  furtherance of the conspiracy.    
        The statement must be considered but does not by itself establish the declarant’s authority under (C); the existence or  scope of the relationship under (D); or the existence of the  conspiracy or participation in it under (E).    
        If a party’s claim, defense, or potential liability is directly  derived from a declarant or the declarant’s principal, a statement that would be admissible against the declarant or the  principal under this rule is also admissible against the party.  

(As amended Pub. L. 94–113, § 1, Oct. 16, 1975, 89 Stat. 576, eff. Oct.  31, 1975; Mar. 2, 1987, eff. Oct. 1, 1987; Apr. 11, 1997, eff. Dec. 1, 1997;  Apr. 26, 2011, eff. Dec. 1, 2011; Apr. 25, 2014, eff. Dec. 1, 2014; Apr.  2, 2024, eff. Dec. 1, 2024.)  

### **Rule 802\. The Rule Against Hearsay**  

Hearsay is not admissible unless any of the following provides  otherwise:    
• a federal statute;

(2) *Excited Utterance.* A statement relating to a startling  event or condition, made while the declarant was under the  stress of excitement that it caused.    
(3) *Then-Existing Mental, Emotional, or Physical Condition.* A  statement of the declarant’s then-existing state of mind (such  as motive, intent, or plan) or emotional, sensory, or physical  condition (such as mental feeling, pain, or bodily health), but  not including a statement of memory or belief to prove the  fact remembered or believed unless it relates to the validity or  terms of the declarant’s will.

If admitted, the record may be read into evidence but may  be received as an exhibit only if offered by an adverse party.  

(6) *Records of a Regularly Conducted Activity.* A record of an  act, event, condition, opinion, or diagnosis if:

    (A) the record was made at or near the time by—or from  information transmitted by—someone with knowledge;

### **Rule 804\. Exceptions to the Rule Against Hearsay—When the declarant Is Unavailable as a Witness**  

(a) CRITERIA FOR BEING UNAVAILABLE. A declarant is considered  to be unavailable as a witness if the declarant:  

    (1) is exempted from testifying about the subject matter of  the declarant’s statement because the court rules that a privilege applies;  
    (2) refuses to testify about the subject matter despite a  court order to do so;  
    (3) testifies to not remembering the subject matter; 
    (4) cannot be present or testify at the trial or hearing because of death or a then-existing infirmity, physical illness, or  mental illness; or    
    (5) is absent from the trial or hearing and the statement’s  proponent has not been able, by process or other reasonable  means, to procure:    

        (A) the declarant’s attendance, in the case of a hearsay  exception under Rule 804(b)(1) or (6); or    
        (B) the declarant’s attendance or testimony, in the case  of a hearsay exception under Rule 804(b)(2), (3), or (4).  But this subdivision (a) does not apply if the statement’s  proponent procured or wrongfully caused the declarant’s un availability as a witness in order to prevent the declarant  from attending or testifying. 

(b) THE EXCEPTIONS. The following are not excluded by the rule  against hearsay if the declarant is unavailable as a witness:  

    (1) *Former Testimony.* Testimony that:    
        (A) was given as a witness at a trial, hearing, or lawful  deposition, whether given during the current proceeding or  a different one; and    
        (B) is now offered against a party who had—or, in a civil  case, whose predecessor in interest had—an opportunity  and similar motive to develop it by direct, cross-, or redirect examination.    

    (2) *Statement Under the Belief of Imminent Death.* In a prosecution for homicide or in a civil case, a statement that the declarant, while believing the declarant’s death to be imminent,  made about its cause or circumstances.    
    (3) *Statement Against Interest.* A statement that:    

        (A) a reasonable person in the declarant’s position would  have made only if the person believed it to be true because, when made, it was so contrary to the declarant’s  proprietary or pecuniary interest or had so great a tend ency to invalidate the declarant’s claim against someone  else or to expose the declarant to civil or criminal liabil ity; and    
        (B) if offered in a criminal case as one that tends to expose the declarant to criminal liability, is supported by  corroborating circumstances that clearly indicate its  trustworthiness after considering the totality of circumstances under which it was made and any evidence that  supports or undermines it.    

    (4) *Statement of Personal or Family History.* A statement  about:    

        (A) the declarant’s own birth, adoption, legitimacy, ancestry, marriage, divorce, relationship by blood, adoption,  or marriage, or similar facts of personal or family history,  even though the declarant had no way of acquiring personal knowledge about that fact; or    
        (B) another person concerning any of these facts, as well  as death, if the declarant was related to the person by  blood, adoption, or marriage or was so intimately associated with the person’s family that the declarant’s information is likely to be accurate. 

    (5) \[*Other Exceptions.*\] \[Transferred to Rule 807.\]  
    (6) *Statement Offered Against a Party That Wrongfully Caused  the Declarant’s Unavailability.* A statement offered against a  party that wrongfully caused—or acquiesced in wrongfully  causing—the declarant’s unavailability as a witness, and did  so intending that result.  

(As amended Pub. L. 94–149, § 1(12), (13), Dec. 12, 1975, 89 Stat. 806;  Mar. 2, 1987, eff. Oct. 1, 1987; Pub. L. 100–690, title VII, § 7075(b),  Nov. 18, 1988, 102 Stat. 4405; Apr. 11, 1997, eff.

### **Rule 805\. Hearsay Within Hearsay**  

Hearsay within hearsay is not excluded by the rule against hear say if each part of the combined statements conforms with an ex ception to the rule.  

(As amended Apr. 26, 2011, eff. Dec. 1, 2011.)  

### **Rule 806\. Attacking and Supporting the Declarant’s Credibility**  

When a hearsay statement—or a statement described in Rule  801(d)(2)(C), (D), or (E)—has been admitted in evidence, the declar ant’s credibility may be attacked, and then supported, by any evidence that would be admissible for those purposes if the declarant  had testified as a witness. The court may admit evidence of the  declarant’s inconsistent statement or conduct, regardless of when  it occurred or whether the declarant had an opportunity to explain or deny it. If the party against whom the statement was ad mitted calls the declarant as a witness, the party may examine  the declarant on the statement as if on cross-examination.  

(As amended Mar. 2, 1987, eff. Oct. 1, 1987; Apr. 11, 1997, eff. Dec.  1, 1997; Apr. 26, 2011, eff. Dec. 1, 2011.)  

### **Rule 807\. Residual Exception**  

(a) IN GENERAL. Under the following conditions, a hearsay statement is not excluded by the rule against hearsay even if the statement is not admissible under a hearsay exception in Rule 803 or  804:  

    (1) the statement is supported by sufficient guarantees of  trustworthiness—after considering the totality of circumstances under which it was made and evidence, if any, corroborating the statement; and  
    (2) it is more probative on the point for which it is offered  than any other evidence that the proponent can obtain  through reasonable efforts.  

(b) NOTICE. The statement is admissible only if the proponent  gives an adverse party reasonable notice of the intent to offer the  statement—including its substance and the declarant’s name—so  that the party has a fair opportunity to meet it. The notice must  be provided in writing before the trial or hearing—or in any form  during the trial or hearing if the court, for good cause, excuses a  lack of earlier notice.  

(As added Apr. 11, 1997, eff. Dec. 1, 1997; amended Apr. 26, 2011, eff.  Dec. 1, 2011; Apr. 25, 2019, eff. Dec. 1, 2019.)

        (A) a particular person, if circumstances, including self identification, show that the person answering was the one  called; or

(1) *Domestic Public Documents That Are Sealed and Signed.* A  document that bears:    

    (A) a seal purporting to be that of the United States; any  state, district, commonwealth, territory, or insular posses sion of the United States; the former Panama Canal Zone;  the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands; a political sub division of any of these entities; or a department, agency,  or officer of any entity named above; and

(2) *Domestic Public Documents That Are Not Sealed but Are  Signed and Certified.* A document that bears no seal if:

The certification may be made by a secretary of a United States embassy  or legation; by a consul general, vice consul, or consular agent  of the United States; or by a diplomatic or consular official of  the foreign country assigned or accredited to the United  States. If all parties have been given a reasonable opportunity  to investigate the document’s authenticity and accuracy, the  court may, for good cause, either:
